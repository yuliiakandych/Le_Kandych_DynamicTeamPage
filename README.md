# Dynamic Team Page  

## Project description  

This is a web-page about our team. 
by clicking on a picture, only one team member's information will be visible on the web page.  
Then by selecting another picture, other member's information will be displayed.

1. A designer created a layout design for a team page and provided an HTML an CSS.
2. A developer created a JS file with an array that holds bio information of each team member.  
3. Each member added his/her own bio info to populate this array.
4. Also, a headline was added for each team member's name  
   that changes based on whose info is currently active. (Lan's colour is red, Yuliia's colour is blue).
